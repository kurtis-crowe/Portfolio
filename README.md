# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| 💰 [Consumer Sales Analysis](https://github.com/kurtis-crowe/Consumer-Sales-Analysis) | Database creation, data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | This repo serves as the solution for DTSC660: Data and Database Management with SQL class at Eastern University. It showcases my ability to tackle various SQL challenges and demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills. | 
| 🏦 [Banking Database Design and analysis](https://github.com/kurtis-crowe/Banking-Database-Design) | Database creation, data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation | Created a banking database, migrated data from a CSV utilizing PostgreSQL. Then I used SQL queries to answer business questions related to customer banking and financial data |  

# Tableau

| Project Link | Project Description |
|---|---|
| 💲 [Regional Sales Analysis](https://github.com/kurtis-crowe/tableau) | Cleansed and transformed data on privately-owned companies (regional supermarkets). Visualised key insights using Tableau, including profit by state map, profit ranking by region, scatterplot to determine correlation between discount percentage and sales, and a line graph for quarterly profit.

# R
